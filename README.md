### Youtube video

This is one of my favorite *YouTube* videos because it is my **favorite** band. The lead singer, *Brendon Urie*, is very talented and this video shows a little bit of his talent. I have seen live videos of him and they are just as good as this one. He makes the video very interesting (like his old music videos were), **spoiler alert**, by adding weird things falling onto the piano at the end.
